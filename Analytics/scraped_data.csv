Download the Jupyter notebook, data and code from links below.
We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its CEO and then apply ML to solve it. I have tried to make this video interactive and interesting by adding cartoon characters/animations. In this project I will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I will teach you how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action. Indeed a very long video but packed with my years of learning!

What is Linear Regression Analysis?
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors:
Which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable?
How significant is the regression line in terms of making predictions with the highest possible accuracy?

Andrew Ng, Machine Learning Specialization - https://imp.i384100.net/P0Q03e

AI is probably the most mysterious, fascinating,and to many, scariest, branch of computer science. Starting today, I plan to teach myself artificial intelligence and machine learning using MOOCs and other online resources.

To do this, I am going to be utilising my own 5-step process that I efficiently use to master any field or concept that I want to learn.

I am especially interested in Deep Learning, a subarea of Machine Learning based on reinforcement learning.

You might not know this, but you actually interact with deep learning algorithms every day.

The reason why you’re addicted to tiktok is because Tiktok’s machine learning algorithm knows precisely the types of videos it should feed you to keep you on the platform.

And how do they know this? It’s certainky not because there is some human sitting and quessing what videos to show you next, no, it is because by giving Tiktok’s clever machine learning algorithms a bunch of previous data of what you’ve watched and kept watching in the past it can figure out what has worked before and keep you giving more and more and more of that content and the more you watch the better it gets at this.

So because ML is a subarea of AI, I figured that the most logocal approach is to first study a general course on ai and then use more specialised resources to go deeper into ml including itsmost powerful manifestation, deep learning

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

Naive bayes theorm uses bayes theorm for conditional probability with a naive assumption that the features are not correlated to each other and tries to find conditional probability of target variable given the probabilities of features. We will use titanic survival dataset here and using naive bayes classifier find out the survival probability of titanic travellers. We use sklearn library and python for this beginners machine learning tutorial. GaussianNB is the classifier we use to train our model. There are other classifiers such as MultinomialNB but we will use that in part 2 of the tutorial.

I got so many requests, but since it's not directly related to Python I thought I should test the ground with an Introduction video before we dive any deeper!
Please let me know in the comments below what you think 😊

In this introduction to the topic, we'll talk about a few Machine Learning approaches (more commonly known as paradigms, but I try to avoid fancy words 😋). I will illustrate the concepts behind each approach with colourful graphics and real life examples.

We'll discuss:
00:39 - Supervised Learning
04:12 - Unsupervised or Self Supervised Learning
05:50 - Reinforcement Learning

What is a Decision Tree Algorithm?
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm for solving classification problems. Generally, a decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top and it is known as the Top-Down Approach. Decision trees are used for handling non-linear data sets effectively. The decision tree tool is used in real life in many areas, such as engineering, civil planning, law, and business.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.

What is Logistics Regression?
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables. Logistic regression uses a logistic function to estimate the probability of a target variable belonging to a particular class or category. It assumes that the dependent variable is binary or dichotomous and there should be no or very little multicollinearity between the predictor variables. Logistic regression

Each python machine learning project I discuss has a corresponding dataset that can be found below. As a beginner data scientist I always recommend learning the basics first and then moving into more advanced models and techniques. That is why I recommend starting with linear regression moving to K-Nearest-Neighbors, Using SVM's and finally trying Neural Networks.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

NOTE: Some errors in the video: 
(1) In the video to calculate the RMSE I put the following statement:
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions- y_test)**2))

When in fact I meant to put:
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))

You can also use the following statements to calculate RMSE:
1. rmse =np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))
2. rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power((np.array(y_test)-np.array(predictions)),2)))
3. rmse = np.sqrt(((predictions - y_test) ** 2).mean())

(2) The preprocessing of data using MinMaxScaler resulted in data leakage, leading to the creation of future bias. Despite this, the code can still be utilized to obtain a basic understanding of Neural Network implementation in Python for classification and prediction purposes.

What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification. It classifies a data point based on its neighbors’ classifications. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similar features. 

When Do We Use the KNN Algorithm?
The KNN algorithm is used in the following scenarios:
✅Data is labeled
✅Data is noise-free
✅Dataset is small, as KNN is a lazy learner

Pros and Cons of Using KNN
✅Pros:  Since the KNN algorithm requires no training before making predictions, new data can be added seamlessly, which will not impact the accuracy of the algorithm.
KNN is very easy to implement. There are only two parameters required to implement KNN—the value of K and the distance function (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
✅Cons: The KNN algorithm does not work well with large datasets. The cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing point is huge, which degrades performance.
Feature scaling (standardization and normalization) is required before applying the KNN algorithm to any dataset. Otherwise, KNN may generate wrong predictions.

But how do we handle text information in dataset? Simple approach is to use interger or label encoding but when categorical variables are nominal, using simple label encoding can be problematic. One hot encoding is the technique that can help in this situation. In this tutorial, we will use pandas get_dummies method to create dummy variables that allows us to perform one hot encoding on given dataset. Alternatively we can use sklearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder as well to create dummy variables.

We'll use data on the USD/BTC price from Yahoo Finance, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page.  

We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow. We'll then switch to an XGBoost model and better predictors to improve accuracy.

We'll develop a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well.  This system will also be able to make next-day predictions.

This project can be extended to other cryptocurrencies, or be used to predict multiple days ahead.

You can find the full code and README here - https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/bitcoin_price .

Maybe you’ve dabbled with unsupervised learning. 

But what about reinforcement learning?

It can be a little tricky to get all setup with RL. You need to manage environments, build your DL models and work out how to save your models down so you can reuse them. But that shouldn’t stop you! 

Why?

Because they’re powering the next generation of advancements in IOT environments and even gaming and the use cases for RL are growing by the minute. That being said, getting started doesn’t need to be a pain, you can get up and running in just 20 minutes working with Keras-RL and OpenAI. 

In this video you’ll learn how to:
1. Create OpenAI Gym environments like CartPole
2. Build a Deep Learning model for Reinforcement Learning using Tensorflow and Keras
3. Train a Reinforcement Learning model using Deep Q Policy based learning using Keras-RL

Fala Impressionadores! Na aula de hoje eu quero te mostrar um projeto de machine learning no Python!

A ideia é te mostrar passo a passo desse projeto para que possamos criar o nosso modelo de machine learning.

Vamos utilizar algumas bibliotecas que você provavelmente já deve ter visto aqui no canal: biblioteca pandas, biblioteca matplotlib, biblioteca seaborn e pandas profling.

Você que ainda não assistiu o vídeo de pandas profiling nós utilizamos para fazer o resumo da base de dados, isso te ajuda a ter uma noção melhor dos seus dados!

E aí vamos ao tratamento da base de dados para criar o nosso modelo de regressão linear e o modelo de árvore de decisão?

About the ML Master's Program

Edureka’s Machine Learning Masters Program makes you proficient in techniques like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing. It includes training on the latest advancements and technical approaches in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning such as Deep Learning, Graphical Models and Reinforcement Learning.

----------------------

Why Learn Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a concept that allows the machine to learn from examples and experience, and that too without being explicitly programmed. So instead of you writing the code, what you do is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/machine builds the logic based on the given data.

🔴 *What is hate speech?*
Any speech that disparages a group of people because of their race, religion, nationality, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity is considered hate speech. Hate speech is frequently used to promote bigotry and hatred. Additionally, it can be applied to threaten and intimidate others. People may experience loneliness, anxiety, and fear as a result. Hate crimes may also result from it. Additionally, hate speech can harm ties between various racial and ethnic groups. It is crucial to identify hate speech since doing so can assist in stopping these negative impacts.

In this series, we'll be covering linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks.

For each major algorithm that we cover, we will discuss the high level intuitions of the algorithms and how they are logically meant to work. Next, we'll apply the algorithms in code using real world data sets along with a module, such as with Scikit-Learn. Finally, we'll be diving into the inner workings of each of the algorithms by recreating them in code, from scratch, ourselves, including all of the math involved. This should give you a complete understanding of exactly how the algorithms work, how they can be tweaked, what advantages are, and what their disadvantages are.

In order to follow along with the series, I suggest you have at the very least a basic understanding of Python. If you do not, I suggest you at least follow the Python 3 Basics tutorial until the module installation with pip tutorial. If you have a basic understanding of Python, and the willingness to learn/ask questions, you will be able to follow along here with no issues. Most of the machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple, since they need to be in order to scale to large datasets. Math involved is typically linear algebra, but I will do my best to still explain all of the math. If you are confused/lost/curious about anything, ask in the comments section on YouTube, the community here, or by emailing me. You will also need Scikit-Learn and Pandas installed, along with others that we'll grab along the way.

Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the ""field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."" This means imbuing knowledge to machines without hard-coding it.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

1) how to hyper tune machine learning model paramers 
2) choose best model for given machine learning problem
We will start by comparing traditional train_test_split approach with k fold cross validation. Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV
but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV. In the end we have interesting exercise for you to solve.

In this video, you'll learn how to leverage action detection to do so!

You'll be able to leverage a keypoint detection model to build a sequence of keypoints which can then be passed to an action detection model to decode sign language! As part of the model building process you'll be able to leverage Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep neural network that leverages LSTM layers to handle the sequence of keypoints.

In this video you'll learn how to: 
1. Extract MediaPipe Holistic Keypoints
2. Build a Sign Language model using a Action Detection powered by LSTM layers
3. Predict sign language in real time using video sequences

Linear regression is the most popular machine learning algorithm, and implementing it in python will help you understand how it works.

First, we'll cover the theory and the equation to calculate the coefficients.  Then we'll implement the equation in python.  We'll end by calculating the r squared value to figure out how well our regression fits the data.

We'll be using data from the Olympics to implement our algorithm.  We'll try to predict how many medals a country will earn based on how many athletes it enters into the Olympics.

You can find the code and data at https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/linear_regression .

(From Scratch #2),"In this video, we implement OCR/image recognition using simple machine learning in Python with no imports! This was streamed live on https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer on 2020/07/06.

Our program uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify images from the mnist and fashion-mnist datasets, meaning it takes digits (1, 2, 3, …) and garments (shoe, t-shirt, …) and guesses what they are (classifies them). It can get up to 93% accuracy on mnist. I wanted this to be a simple introduction to machine learning for those not very familiar with it.

The full code including more details is available at https://git.sr.ht/~vladh/clumsycomputer/tree/main/item/from-scratch-2-ocr

Because this is a recording of a live stream, you'll hear me sometimes talking to the chat.

Nesse vídeo, apresento um exemplo básico de construção de um modelo de ML, introduzindo ideias que aplicaremos para aprender a classificar portáteis com base nos dados de treino e na sequencia iremos verificar a performance com os dados de teste.

Nessa Introdução ao Machine Learning (Aprendizado de Máquina ou Aprendizagem de Maquina) desmistifico do zero até o modelo pronto um aprendizado que poderia formar praticamente um curso de Machine Learning. Você irá aprender a como utilizar a biblioteca ""scikit-learn"" que é uma das mais famosas para Python e a Pandas, capaz de armazenar dataframes.

We will be using the data available on Kaggle to create this machine learning model. The collected tweets from Twitter will be analysed using machine learning to identify the different sentiments present in the tweets. The different sentiments identified in this project include positive sentiment, negative sentiment and neutral sentiment. We will also be using different classifiers to see which classifier gives the best model accuracy. The dataset links are attached below.

This is Chapter -7 and in this chapter, we will talk about how to judge the performance of our machine learning algorithm.

This is a video series on scikit learn tutorial. In this series I'm talking about using scikit learn machine learning for our implementations
 
Machine learning Algorithm selection faces a unique catch22 situation where you get the data to train but need unseen(new)data to test the algorithm which is available only with production.

To avoid this situation and understand the performance of the selected Machine Learning algorithm, we need to generate TEST DATASET from the available DATA Set.

We can do the same by segregating the available dataset in Training Data Set and Testing Data Set.  Scikit Learn provides a utility function called train_test_split which can help us to achieve this goal

This video explains the usage of train_test_split function and how we can generate training and testing datasets.

What is Myers Briggs Personality Prediction?

The MBTI test was developed to help people understand personality traits in a wider range of people. The MBTI test can help people understand their strengths, limitations, and potential differences from others, even if there is no such thing as ""better"" or ""worse"" personality preferences.

Types of MBTI Indicators

Extraversion (E) – Introversion (I)

Sensing (S) – Intuition (N)

Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)

Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

On these bases, there are 16 types: ISTJ, ISTP, ISFJ, ISFP, INFJ, INFP, INTJ, INTP, ESTP, ESTJ, ESFP, ESFJ, ENFP, ENFJ, ENTP, ENTJ.

O Machine Learning representa um novo paradigma na programação, onde, em vez de programar regras explícitas em uma linguagem como Java ou C ++, você constrói um sistema treinado em dados para inferir as próprias regras. Mas como é realmente o ML? Na parte um do Machine Learning de Zero a 100 André Lírio nos apresenta um exemplo básico de construção de um modelo de ML, introduzindo idéias que aplicaremos em episódios posteriores a um problema mais interessante: a visão computacional.

This helps the training algorithm to learn the features as we have enough examples for all the different cases. For example, in learning a spam filter, we should have good amount of data which corresponds to emails which are spam and non spam.

This even distribution is not always possible. I'll discuss one of the techniques known as Undersampling that helps us tackle this issue.

Undersampling is one of the techniques used for handling class imbalance. In this technique, we under sample majority class to match the minority class.

Find-S Algorithm (Concept):
https://youtu.be/FgqtsPkeklg

Visit our website for more Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence blogs
https://www.codewrestling.com


Find-S Algorithm
1. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
2. For each positive training instance x
        2.1 For each attribute constraint a i in h :
                2.1.1 If the constraint a i in h is satisfied by x Then do nothing
                2.1.2 Else replace a i in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
3. Output hypothesis h


(important) Guaranteed to output the most specific hypothesis within H that is consistent with the positive training examples.
(important) Notice that negative examples are ignored.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

Now, we're going to dig into how K Nearest Neighbors works so we have a full understanding of the algorithm itself, to better understand when it will and wont work for us.
We will come back to our breast cancer dataset, using it on our custom-made K Nearest Neighbors algorithm and compare it to Scikit-Learn's, but we're going to start off with some very simple data first. K Nearest Neighbors boils down to proximity, not by group, but by individual points. Thus, all this algorithm is actually doing is computing distance between points, and then picking the most popular class of the top K classes of points nearest to it. There are various ways to compute distance on a plane, many of which you can use here, but the most accepted version is Euclidean Distance, named after Euclid, a famous mathematician who is popularly referred to as the father of Geometry, and he definitely wrote the book (The Elements) on it.

Project Title: Detection of Phishing Websites Using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/.

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Criminals seeking sensitive information construct illegal clones of actual websites and e-mail accounts. The e-mail will be made up of real firm logos and slogans. When a user clicks on a link provided by these hackers, the hackers gain access to all of the user's private information, including bank account information, personal login passwords, and images. Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms are heavily employed in present systems, and their accuracy has to be enhanced. The existing models have low latency. Existing systems do not have a specific user interface. In the current system, different algorithms are not compared. Consumers are led to a faked website that appears to be from the authentic company when the e-mails or the links provided are opened. The models are used to detect phishing Websites based on URL significance features, as well as to find and implement the optimal machine learning model. Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and XG Boost are the machine learning methods that are compared. The Logistic Regression algorithm outperforms the other two.

About the Course
Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.

Numpy: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Matplotlib: For Python and its numerical extension NumPy, Matplotlib is a cross-platform data visualization and graphical charting package. As a result, it presents a strong open-source substitute for MATLAB.

Re: A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

RegEx: A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Project Title: Plant Disease Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithm.
Implementation: PYTHON.
Web Framework: Flask.
Algorithm / Model Used: InceptionV3 Architecture.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base Paper Abstract:
Agriculture accepts a basic part by virtue of the quick improvement of the general population and extended interest in food in India. Hence, it is required to increase harvest yield. One serious cause of low collect yield is an infection brought about by microorganisms, infection, and organisms. Plant disease investigation is one of the major and essential tasks in the part of cultivating. It tends to be forestalled by utilizing plant disease detection techniques. To monitor, observe or take care of plant diseases manually is a very complex task. It requires gigantic proportions of work, and moreover needs outrageous planning time; consequently, image processing is utilized to distinguish diseases of plants. Plant disease classification can be done by using machine learning algorithms which include steps like dataset creation, load pictures, pre-preparing, segmentation, feature extraction, training classifier, and classification. The main objective of this research is to construct one model, which classifies the healthy and diseased harvest leaves and predicts diseases of plants. In this paper, the researchers have trained a model to recognize some unique harvests and 26 diseases from the public dataset which contains 54,306 images of the diseases and healthy plant leaves that are collected under controlled conditions. This paper worked on the ResNets algorithm. A residual neural network (ResNet) is a subpart of the artificial neural network (ANN). ResNet algorithm contains a residual block that can be used to solve the problem of vanishing/exploding gradient. ResNet algorithm is also used for creating Residual Network. For the image classification, ResNets achieve a much well result. The ResNets techniques applied some of the parameters like scheduling learning rate, gradient clipping, and weight decay. Using the ResNet algorithm, the researchers expect high accuracy results and detecting more diseases from the various harvests.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. 

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

(about the  IEEE paper we refered)
Agriculture is one of the major and the least paid occupation in India. Machine learning can bring a boom in the agriculture field by changing the income scenario through growing the optimum crop. This paper focuses on predicting the yield of the crop by applying various machine learning techniques. The outcome of these techniques is compared on the basis of mean absolute error. The prediction made by machine learning algorithms will help the farmers to decide which crop to grow to get the maximum yield by considering factors like temperature, rainfall, area, etc.

By now, I am assuming you have the data downloaded, or you're just here to watch. With most machine learning, you need to take the data and, at some point, you need to have input and output. With neural networks, this means input layer and output layers for the actual neural network. For a chatbot, this means we need to separate things out to be a comment, and then a reply.

Project Title: Face Recognition based Attendance System using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: KNeighbors Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
In the near future, face recognition-based attendance systems will be utilized in all places instead of the traditional approach; it may even replace biometric attendance systems. The goal of this project is to create a new attendance system based on real-time facial recognition. Face recognition technology is also used by Facebook, which tags the names of faces when you submit photographs that have already been tagged by you. The proposed system recognizes and encodes the unique traits of the faces in the database into a pattern image. Python modules are employed in our suggested system, and a machine learning approach called a classifier is used to discover the person's name. The steps of the operation are image capture, facial features, face recognition, and an attendance system. This model combines a camera that records an input image, an algorithm for detecting faces in input images, encoding and identifying the faces, and recording attendance in a spreadsheet. The training database is built by inputting the faces of permitted pupils into the system. After that, the cropped photographs are saved in a database with their associated labels. The attendance is recorded using the matching face.

Project Title: Fraud Detection on Bank Payments Using Machine Learning
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Random Forest Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE BASE PAPER ABSTRACT:
This paper consists of fraud detection and measures to automate it fully. For every bank, it has become essential for Fraud detection. Fraud is rising significantly, which ends in many damages for the banks. Transactions create unique challenges for fraud exposure due to the lack of short-term processing. The foremost task is a feasibility study of chosen fraud detection methods. With the help of models, these transactions are to be tested individually and further proceeded. We first define a detection task: attributes of the dataset, the metric choice, and any techniques to control such unbalanced datasets. This leads to the fact that the underlying pattern generating the dataset results: For example, cardholders may improve their purchasing habits over periods, and fraudsters may change their tactics. Later, we highlighted several methods used to obtain the sequential features of credit card transactions.

What are pixels?
Pixels are the raw building blocks of an image. Every image consists of a set of pixels. There is no finer granularity than the pixel.

Normally, a pixel is considered the “color” or the “intensity” of light that appears in a given place in our image.
Most pixels are represented in two ways:

1. Grayscale/single channel
2. Color
In a grayscale image, each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, where 0 corresponds to “black” and 255 being “white.” The values between 0 and 255 are varying shades of gray, where values closer to 0 are darker and values closer 255 are lighter
Each of the three Red, Green, and Blue colors are represented by an integer in the range from 0 to 255, which indicates how “much” of the color there is. Given that the pixel value only needs to be in the range [0, 255], we normally use an 8-bit unsigned integer to represent each color intensity.
We then combine these values into an RGB tuple in the form (red, green, blue). This tuple represents our color.

Images in OpenCV are represented by NumPy arrays. To access a particular image pixel, all we need to do is pass in the (x, y)-coordinates as image[y, x]:

Numerous seasonal, economic and biological patterns influence the crop production but unpredictable changes in these patterns lead to a great loss to farmers. These risks can be reduced when suitable approaches are employed on data related to soil type, temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and crop type. Whereas, crop and weather forecasting can be predicted by deriving useful insights from these agricultural data that aids farmers to decide on the crop they would like to plant for the forthcoming year leading to maximum profit. This paper presents a survey on the various algorithms used for weather, crop yield, and crop cost prediction.

Project Title: Fraud Detection and Analysis for Insurance Claim using Machine Learning.
Implementation: PYTHON.
Algorithm / Model Used: Random Forest Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base Paper Abstract:
Insurance Company working as commercial enterprise from last few years has been experiencing fraud cases for all type of claims. Amount claimed by fraudulent is significantly huge that may causes serious problems, hence along with government, different organization also working to detect and reduce such activities. Such frauds occurred in all areas of insurance claim with high severity such as insurance claimed towards auto sector is fraud that widely claimed and prominent type, which can be done by fake accident claim. So, we aim to develop a project that work on insurance claim data set to detect fraud and fake claims amount. The project implements machine learning algorithms to build model to label and classify claim. Also, to study comparative study of all machine learning algorithms used for classification using confusion matrix in term soft accuracy, precision, recall etc. For fraudulent transaction validation, machine learning model is built using PySpark Python Library.

Project Title: Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Random Forest Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has made predicting their prices an important area of research. The volatility and complexity of Bitcoin make it a challenging task to accurately predict its price. While past research has implemented machine learning to enhance the precision of Bitcoin price prediction, limited attention has been given to examining the viability of employing diverse modeling techniques to datasets with varying data structures and dimensional attributes. In order to forecast Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques at different intervals, this study initiates by categorizing Bitcoin prices into daily prices and high-frequency prices. This project aims to predict the price of Bitcoin using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The dataset used for this project consists of historical Bitcoin price data from July 2010 to May 2023. The data was preprocessed and feature engineering was performed to extract relevant features for the model. The Random Forest Classifier algorithm was used to predict the price of Bitcoin based on the input features. The algorithm was trained on the preprocessed data and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model performance. Moreover, as an extension to our work, we have created a simulation dashboard utilizing Flask, a popular web framework model. This dashboard enables users to evaluate various machine learning algorithms to assess their performance in predicting Bitcoin prices. With this platform, researchers and traders alike can explore and compare the accuracy and effectiveness of different models in different scenarios, thereby enhancing their understanding and decision-making capabilities within the cryptocurrency market. The results of the project show that the Random Forest Classifier algorithm achieved 99% accuracy in predicting the price of Bitcoin. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting the price of Bitcoin.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

Separate the reality of modern AI from the hype – by learning about deep learning, well, deeply. You will need some familiarity with Python and linear algebra to follow along, but if you have that experience, you will find that neural networks are not as complicated as they sound. And how they actually work is quite elegant!

This is hands-on tutorial with real code you can download, study, and run yourself.

Project Title: Air Quality Prediction Based on Machine Learning
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Random Forest Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
In recent years, due to the vigorous development of industrialization, environmental protection measures cannot be effectively guaranteed. Increasingly serious environmental problems have gradually become the primary problem affecting the quality of national life. Therefore, we need to establish a relatively accurate air quality prediction model to understand the possible air pollution process in advance. According to the prediction results of the model, it is of great significance to establish and take corresponding control measures to reduce air pollution. This paper makes full use of data mining methods such as mutual information theory, neural networks, and intelligent optimization algorithm. We use the basic data of long-term air quality prediction of open monitoring points as training set and test set. Firstly, the SOM neural network model is used for unsupervised clustering of relevant pollutant data to analyze the correlation between various monitored pollutants. Aiming at the problems of a large amount of data and long calculation time of the algorithm, combined with the clustering results, and NSGA-II optimized neural network is proposed to predict the future pollution situation. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of pollutants can reach more than 90%.

Project Title: Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning.
IEEE Base Paper Title: A New Intelligent Approach for Effective Recognition of Diabetes in the IoT E-HealthCare Environment.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Bagging Ensemble Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
In this paper we aim to develop a prediction system using machine learning to detect and classify the presence of diabetes in e-healthcare environment using Ensemble Decision Tree Algorithms for high feature selection. A significant attention has been made to the accurate detection of diabetes which is a big challenge for the research community to develop a diagnosis system to detect diabetes in a successful way in the e-healthcare environment. The existing diagnosis systems have some drawbacks, such as high computation time, and low prediction accuracy. To handle these issues, we have proposed diagnosis system using machine learning methods, such as preprocessing of data, feature selection, and classification for the detection of diabetes disease in e- healthcare environment. Model validation and performance evaluation metrics have been used to check the validity of the proposed system.

Project Title: Soil Analysis and Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: MobileNetV2 Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
India is the land of agriculture and is among the top three global producers of many crops. The Indian farmer lies at the heart of the agricultural sector yet most Indian farmers remain at the bottom of the social strata. In addition, farmers find it difficult to decide which crop is best suitable and profitable for their soil, in spite of the few technological solutions that exist today, due to the variation in soil types across geographical regions. This paper proposes a crop recommendation system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Random Forest Model to predict the optimal crop to be grown by analyzing various parameters including the region, soil type, yield, selling price, etc. The CNN architecture gave an accuracy of 95.21%, and the Random Forest Algorithm had an accuracy of 75%.

Building real-world projects is a great way to apply & improve your machine learning skills. In this workshop, we will walk through the process of building a classical machine learning project using Python & Scikit-learn.

Here's what the workshop covers:
1. Finding a real-world dataset on Kaggle
2. Downloading and exploring the data
3. Preparing the data for machine learning
4. Creating hardcoded and baseline models
5. Making predictions and submitting to Kaggle
6. Trying different models & tuning hyperparameters
7. Feature engineering, ensembling & other optimizations
8. Tracking experiments & results systematically
9. Incorporating ideas from public notebooks & discussions
10. Documenting and publishing your work online

The workshop lasts 3 hours, and we write all the code from scratch, starting with a blank Jupyter notebook. Attendees will be able to ask questions live. A recording of the workshop will be shared later, which you can use to follow along and create your own ML project.

Prerequisites
This workshop assumes some prior knowledge of classical machine learning. If you're new to machine learning, you can get started with our free course ""Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs"" at https://zerotogbms.com .

You’ve done a bunch of Exploratory Data Analysis. 

You’ve trained a bunch of models. 

They’re pretty accurate.

Now what?

Now, you deploy them! This is one of the final steps in the CRISP-DM lifecycle. Once you’ve evaluated your models and you’re happy to release them into the wild, this is generally the step you’re going to want to take. 

But how?

Well, in this video you’ll learn exactly how to do that. You’ll learn step by step how to take a trained Scikit-Learn model and deploy it to the Cloud using Watson Machine Learning. This model can then be used for a whole bunch of applications and can even be used in different languages like Javascript, Scala, Java and Go. And what’s best? You’ll do it all in less than half an hour. 

In this video you’ll learn how to: 
1. Saving models to Watson Machine Learning
2. Creating online  deployments with Python
3. Scoring your model using the Python API

Machine Learning with Python Full Course 2023 | Python for Data Science |Python for Machine Learning
Hello and welcome to a Data science tutorial i.e. Python for machine learning, in 2023, presented by Great Learning. In this Python tutorial, you will be able to learn mathematical calculation, data frame manipulation & visualization with the aid of very important packages in python and the data science community i.e. NumPy, Pandas, & how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#pythonfordatascience #machinelearningwithpython 

Topics Covered:
00:01:21 – NumPy
00:53:05 – Pandas
01:52:55 – Data Visualization (Plots Using Matplotlib & Seaborn)

What is NumPy?
NumPy is a tool for mathematical computing and data preparation in Python. It can be utilized to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays, such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines. This library provides many useful features, including handling n-dimensional arrays, broadcasting, performing operations, data generation, etc. Thus, it’s the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It also provides a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on arrays.

NumPy Arrays:
NumPy arrays will be the main focus of this course. So, what are arrays? Arrays are a reserved space in memory for a list of values. These arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices. Vectors are strictly one-dimensional, and matrices are two or more dimensional arrays. They certainly take part in the root architecture of programming and give a whole lot of new possibilities, which will be explored later on. 

What are Pandas?
In short, Pandas is a Software Library in Computer Programming, and it is written for the Python Programming Language. It works to do data analysis and manipulation.
How to use Matplotlib
Before using Matplotlib, we need to import the package. This can be done using the ‘import’ method in Jupyter notebook. PyPlot is the graphical module in Matplotlib, which is mostly used for data visualization. Importing PyPlot is sufficient to work around data visualization.

Seaborn:
Seaborn is an amazing data visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on top of the Matplotlib library and is closely integrated with pandas' data structures. In this tutorial, we shall see how to use seaborn to make a variety of plots and how we can use it along with Matplotlib to make our plots more attractive.

Project Title: Alzheimer’s disease Detection using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: CNN Model Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurological disorder. For the AD, there is no specific treatment. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease can help patients receive the correct care. Many studies employ statistical and machine learning techniques to diagnose AD. The human-level performance of Deep Learning algorithms has been effectively shown in different disciplines. In the proposed methodology, the MRI data is used to identify the AD and Deep Learning technique is used to classify the present disease. The classification of Alzheimer’s disease using deep learning methods has shown promising results, and successful application in clinical settings requires a combination of high accuracy, short processing time, and generalizability to various populations. In this study, we developed a system of Alzheimer’s disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans images which are trained using Kaggle dataset. The models in this study are trained on the same dataset in order to analyse their performances. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture gives the highest accuracy where training accuracy is 86.34% and validation accuracy is 86.45% on the test data that detects AD accurately.

This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.

In the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).

DDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.

Project Title: Detecting A Twitter Cyberbullying Using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Naïve Bayes.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Social media is a platform where many young people are getting bullied. As social networking sites are increasing, cyberbullying is increasing day by day. To identify word similarities in the tweets made by bullies and make use of machine learning and can develop an ML model automatically detect social media bullying actions. However, many social media bullying detection techniques have been implemented, but many of them were textual based. The goal of this paper is to show the implementation of software that will detect bullied tweets, posts, etc. A machine learning model is proposed to detect and prevent bullying on Twitter. Two classifiers i.e. SVM and Naïve Bayes are used for training and testing the social media bullying content. Both Naive Bayes and SVM (Support Vector Machine) were able to detect the true positives with 71.25% and 52.70% accuracy respectively. But SVM outperforms Naive Bayes of similar work on the same dataset. Also, Twitter API is used to fetch tweets and tweets are passed to the model to detect whether the tweets are bullying or not.

Ridge regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, and learning how it works can help you use it more effectively.

We'll cover what ridge regression is, including the theory and equation.  Then we'll implement it in python and compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.  We'll end by learning how to calculate the optimal penalty lambda.

It's recommended to watch the video on linear regression before this one (https://youtu.be/z2hpinQggNM).

In this project we will explore about Bitcoin and also we will predict the price of bitcoin using Machine Learning algorithm.

You can use Google Colab or Kaggle Notebook where you don't need to look at prerequisite of creating virtual environment and downloading TensorFlow.

Here we will use LSTM model in Tensorflow to build our model and then we will predict the bitcoin price.

The data about Bitcoin can be found on Yahoo Finance
Link:  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD


There are few things we can change and improve the performance of the model you can finetune the model as well as increase the data in the dataset , you can add more layers if you want.

Tweak the parameter and see what performance model gives.

Investment is a business activity on which most people are interested in this globalization era. There are several objects that are often used for investment, for example, gold, stocks and property. In particular, property investment has increased significantly. Housing price trends are not only the concern of buyers and sellers, but it also indicates the current economic situation. There are many factors which has impact on house prices, such as numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms. Even the nearby location, a location with a great accessibility to highways, expressways, schools, shopping malls and local employment opportunities contributes to the rise in house price. Manual house predication becomes difficult, hence there are many systems developed for house price prediction.

The primary goal of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for employees working in an organization in order to improve and upgrade the current attendance system to make it more efficient and effective than before. The employee should be in an area containing light so that the detection can be clearly made.

The facial recognition feature embedded in the attendance monitoring system not only ensures accurate attendance but also eliminates flaws. Using a system to overcome defects not only saves resources but also reduces human intervention in the overall process by delegating all complex tasks to the system.

Instead, they can assist developers in various ways. Here are a few examples:

Code Generation:
Documentation and Knowledge Retrieval:
Debugging and Troubleshooting:
Natural Language Interfaces:
Testing and Quality Assurance:
 
It's important to note that while language models like ChatGPT can be valuable tools for developers, they do not possess the same level of understanding and contextual reasoning as human developers. They lack the ability to grasp complex requirements, make high-level architectural decisions, or exhibit creative problem-solving skills. Human developers still play a crucial role in software development, including tasks like system design, algorithm development, and critical thinking, which cannot be fully replaced by AI models.",2023-06-21T03:29:35Z,6.3K views,521,267,39

A meta-analysis of 151 studies found a positive relationship between intelligence and job performance of leaders in many different settings. The relationship is likely to be higher when the leader plays an active role in decision making and is not overly stressed.  The researchers also found support for the old idea that intelligence contributes the most to leadership effectiveness when the leader is not vastly smarter than most group members.

Again, group members prefer that their leaders be smarter than the average group member even if the difference is not huge. Cognitive intelligence is all the more useful for leadership when it is supplemented by practical intelligence, the ability to solve everyday problems by using experience-based knowledge to adapt to and shape the environment. Practical intelligence is sometimes referred to as street smarts, and also includes wisdom. Recent evidence suggests that specific problem-solving skills, such as wisdom, are more closely related to leader performance than general intelligence.",2021-05-17T19:00:00Z,1.7K views,102,24,1

GitHub Repository - https://github.com/codeayan/textToSpeechWatson

EXPLANATION
-----------
%pip install ibm-watson


from ibm_watson import SpeechToTextV1
- This line imports the SpeechToTextV1 class from the ibm_watson module. The SpeechToTextV1 class is part of the IBM Watson Speech to Text service. It provides methods and functionality for converting spoken language into written text.


from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator
- This line imports the IAMAuthenticator class from the ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators module. The IAMAuthenticator class is used to authenticate and authorize requests made to IBM Cloud services, including IBM Watson services. It provides a mechanism for securely authenticating API requests using IBM's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. 


apiUrl = ""Paste your API URL here""
myKey = ""Paste your API Key here""


auth = IAMAuthenticator(myKey)
- IAMAuthenticator(myKey) creates an instance of the IAMAuthenticator class, passing the myKey variable as a parameter. This associates the API key with the authenticator instance. This helps ensure that only authorized users with valid API keys can access the service and perform actions like speech-to-text conversions.


Speech2Text = SpeechToTextV1(authenticator = auth)
- This line creates an instance of the SpeechToTextV1 class and assigns it to the variable Speech2Text. The SpeechToTextV1 class is part of the IBM Watson Speech to Text service and provides methods and functionality for converting spoken language into written text. The authenticator=auth parameter specifies that the Speech2Text instance should use the authenticator object (created previously) for authentication. B


Speech2Text.set_service_url(apiUrl)
- This line sets the service URL for the Speech2Text instance. The set_service_url method is provided by the SpeechToTextV1 class and is used to specify the endpoint URL of the IBM Watson Speech to Text service that the instance will communicate with. By passing this URL to the set_service_url method, the Speech2Text instance is configured to send requests to the specified endpoint when performing speech-to-text conversions.


with open(""test_audio.wav"", mode=""rb"") as wav: 
- This line opens the file ""test_audio.wav"" in binary mode (mode=""rb""). The with statement is used here to ensure proper handling and automatic cleanup of the file resource after it's used. By opening the file in binary mode (""rb""), it indicates that the file should be read as binary data. 


    response = Speech2Text.recognize(audio=wav, content_type=""audio/wav"")
    - This line sends a recognition request to the IBM Watson Speech to Text service using the s2t instance created earlier. The recognize method is provided by the SpeechToTextV1 class. It is used to send audio data for speech-to-text conversion. The audio parameter is set to wav, which represents the file object obtained from opening ""test_audio.wav"". This provides the audio data to be sent for recognition. The content_type parameter is set to ""audio/wav"" to specify the type of audio data being sent. In this case, it indicates that the audio data is in WAV format.  
    

    recognized_text = response.result['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript']
    - This line extracts the recognized text from the response received from the IBM Watson Speech to Text service and assigns it to the variable recognized_text. Here's a breakdown of the expression: response.result retrieves the JSON response received from the IBM Watson Speech to Text service.['results'][0] accesses the first element in the ""results"" array within the response. The Speech to Text service may provide multiple results, such as different transcriptions or alternatives. ['alternatives'][0] accesses the first alternative within the ""alternatives"" array of the selected result. An alternative represents a possible transcription for the given audio. ['transcript'] retrieves the ""transcript"" field from the selected alternative, which contains the recognized text. By combining these expressions, the line extracts the recognized text from the response and stores it in the recognized_text variable for further usage or display.


recognized_text
- Printing the text version of the speech

Kids who were nerdy and never did any kind of sports were considered the most intelligent and bright.
The jocks who were sporty and fit, were often branded as simple-minded and empty-headed.
So by following this stereotype you had two groups: Smart and weak. Dumb and fit.

However in the recent years, there's a new stereotype that's gained popularity: A smart jock.
An individual who is both intellectually gifted and is physically fit.
Did they win the genetic lottery or is it possible that exercise could make you smarter?

Today we'll look at the body-brain connection and how moving our body can benefit the brain.
