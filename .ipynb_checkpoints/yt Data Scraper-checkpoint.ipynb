About 2 weeks owning and using frequently and for many things.\\r<br>\\r<br>NO HEADPHONE JACK?! THE ONE THING YOU HAD TO MOCK OR EMULATE, REALLY?! As an Audio Lover, A whole generation of people who still know how to use headphone jacks and connect their things to boomin sound systems with 15s and such? - You even have an Equalizer? FOR WHAT? This thing has BAD SOUND! BAD SPEAKERS! (Compared to my LG, That is, Thing was amazing)\\r<br>\\r<br>Overheats on basic use, VERY HOT VERY VERY HOT? Not using Camera AT ALL? (Seemed to be a &quot;reason&quot;) HOT AF ON just basic Pokemon Go use? What? Just watch it Glow Red while only attempting to download a few files. I feel I&#39;m going to break it. No kidding. It&#39;s that hot. With no case even. \\r<br>\\r<br>Navigation buttons / Cannot re-arrange.  What?  Why? Hello?   I see on Forums Years of asking &quot;WHY?&quot;, so Why?\\r<br>\\r<br>Pull down top menu? Can&#39;t pull down on it&#39;s side, There is no Wide, Sidescreen variation, you HAVE to rotate and pull down from top. ONLY\\r<br>\\r<br>The Camera on the back? Bulbus! edged, sticks out a lot.

Mostly bad cases for a mostly bad device. <b>adjusts glasses</b>\\r<br>\\r<br>Short battery life that begs me to turn on &quot;Saver&quot; features. &quot;No&quot; - I want full power, good brightness, loud sound. etc. The base functions of the device Suffer on this electronic and I&#39;m just not sure why.\\r<br>\\r<br>The Camera? Nice, But - The App it&#39;s self (google photos) seems to stumble (maybe it&#39;s just me) on most base functions as well, there is no quick way to edit, sometimes, other than RIGHT when you take the pic, this is fine, but the finalization step is a bit tedious when trying to get multiple pics in a timely manner. I&#39;m not a fan of using 3rd part apps constatly (Paying, free versions, ads, etc just to edit a pic my phone took? cmon now, Better default software pls)\\r<br>\\r<br>The power button and general hand use, Already kinda annoyed that Taking a screencap now makes me pinch and push one side of my phone in order to hit the power and vol down at the same time? Like? What?   Makes WAY more sense, even for smaller hands, to have the buttons be on Opposite sides of the phone? *If it was built to be so quick 1 handed, then why even include the on screen navigation buttons that you can&#39;t adjust /at all /ever? As a formality? a barely functional lie? - My point, Reaching one&#39;s thumb, as a right handed person, to the bottom left corner, to go &quot;BACK&quot; - A VERY COMMON PRACTICE?!, Is just a massive NO, BAD, BAD PHONE MAKERS, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID! you&#39;re almost forcing iPhone mock controls or 2 handed use? oof.\\r<br>\\r<br>There is no High Screen Resolution for the reg 7, Only Pro* - No 1440p for you, just 1080 (which is fine imo)\\r<br>\\r<br>The Updates I got? All security, not really any ease of use - So I guess they are hard up to keep this thing like THIS, A Mess. \\r<br>\\r<br>Justify owning this thing however you wish, but I see why they pushed me out the door after I was &quot;Dumb enough&quot; to not inquire about the Samsung I could have got instead.
