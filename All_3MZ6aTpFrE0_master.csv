85,"@Akansha if you&#39;re willing to wait for a few days (till may 11th), you can see the pixel 7a pricing and all too. It will be priced higher at launch than at sales but might come with some launch offers like bundled pair of pixel buds and all so if you&#39;re interested in that. Other than that pixel 7a will go on diwali sale for around 30k so you could wait for a few months if you have the time and a functioning phone right now. Else the pixel 7 at 45k is not at all a bad deal and a pretty great smartphone for your use case",312535_1
86,@Akansha can go with iPhone 13 (if on sale which usually comes at about 57k) or pixel 7 which is 45k rn and has almost the best camera performance along with pretty decent general performance too. S23 is out of budget and not that big of an upgrade from pixel 7 so yeah pixel 7 is the best deal at 45k for your use case if you don&#39;t do hard-core gaming (not the usual subway surfers or bgmi sessions but the intense genshin impact at 1080p ultra quality and all),396403_1

94,"@Eva girl a very good device indeed (if you can afford it). Battery life is better than the s22 series and I&#39;d highly recommend the s23 if you want to go with a Samsung.. else you can wait just a few days for the pixel 7a too.

106,"Vivo X90 is a hypothetical phone model that hasn&#39;t been officially released yet, so there are no confirmed details about its features. However, based on the naming convention of Vivo&#39;s previous models, it&#39;s possible that X90 could be a premium or high-end device that comes with advanced camera capabilities.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in purchasing a Vivo phone with good camera features, you can consider some of the company&#39;s existing models, such as Vivo X60 Pro+, which features a quad-camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor, a 48MP ultra-wide sensor, a 32MP portrait sensor, and an 8MP periscope telephoto lens. The phone also has advanced features such as 5-axis stabilization, 60x hybrid zoom, and 8K video recording.<br><br>Alternatively, if you have specific requirements for the camera features you need, feel free to let me know, and I can provide more tailored suggestions.",352730_1
