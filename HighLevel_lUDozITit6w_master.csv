9,"Hey Rupesh, 
I own a OnePlus 8t and had a very bad experience with both OnePlus and Oppo devices with their motherboard crash.
Now I'm planning to move to the Pixel devices.
Looking at the current prices I can see that Pixel 6a is a great deal, but still Pixel 7a is pulling me because of its 90 hz display and Sony IMX786 sensor compared to very old sensor on Pixel 6a.
But the only thing I'm worried is about prices. I'm not getting that interest to spend huge amount of money on smartphones. Do you think the 6GB RAM and 60 hz works for me, as I have 120hz and 12gb RAM on OnePlus 8t
Please advise me on this.",690546_1

Suppose you use Google Maps to go somewhere. After 20 mins, the phone will automatically switch to dark mode to cool down the device. You cannot see the navigation in the day in dark mode. Another incident was I was on an important Zoom call. The device closed the app automatically to cool down the device. There was no way I could shut that feature. I had to wait for the device to cool down. The call was barely 1-1.30 hr. Yes, the photos are amazingly superb, but I have to charge the phone twice a day to keep it live.

165,"DO Not Buy. Coming from an LGV40ThinQ  to  Pixel 7 (Not Pro) - I feel Downgraded. 

Pixel 7 : *IS A FAUX iPHONE - Let's start there. Know what you're getting into. About 2 weeks owning and using frequently and for many things.

NO HEADPHONE JACK?! THE ONE THING YOU HAD TO MOCK OR EMULATE, REALLY?! As an Audio Lover, A whole generation of people who still know how to use headphone jacks and connect their things to boomin sound systems with 15s and such? - You even have an Equalizer? FOR WHAT? This thing has BAD SOUND! BAD SPEAKERS! (Compared to my LG, That is, Thing was amazing)

Overheats on basic use, VERY HOT VERY VERY HOT? Not using Camera AT ALL? (Seemed to be a ""reason"") HOT AF ON just basic Pokemon Go use? What? Just watch it Glow Red while only attempting to download a few files. I feel I'm going to break it. No kidding. It's that hot. With no case even. 

Navigation buttons / Cannot re-arrange.  What?  Why? Hello?   I see on Forums Years of asking ""WHY?"", so Why?

Pull down top menu? Can't pull down on it's side, There is no Wide, Sidescreen variation, you HAVE to rotate and pull down from top. ONLY

The Camera on the back? Bulbus! edged, sticks out a lot. If you get a message? Phone ""Flat"" on a table? - This thing will slide around as if it was the Winter Olympics.

SLICK CASE - Will slide out of, off of, into, anything. Buy a case ASAP - All Cases I Found btw? If it's not a clunky OTTER style, it's not Flush with the surface. Mostly bad cases for a mostly bad device. *adjusts glasses*

Short battery life that begs me to turn on ""Saver"" features. ""No"" - I want full power, good brightness, loud sound. etc. The base functions of the device Suffer on this electronic and I'm just not sure why.

The Camera? Nice, But - The App it's self (google photos) seems to stumble (maybe it's just me) on most base functions as well, there is no quick way to edit, sometimes, other than RIGHT when you take the pic, this is fine, but the finalization step is a bit tedious when trying to get multiple pics in a timely manner. I'm not a fan of using 3rd part apps constatly (Paying, free versions, ads, etc just to edit a pic my phone took? cmon now, Better default software pls)

The power button and general hand use, Already kinda annoyed that Taking a screencap now makes me pinch and push one side of my phone in order to hit the power and vol down at the same time? Like? What?   Makes WAY more sense, even for smaller hands, to have the buttons be on Opposite sides of the phone? *If it was built to be so quick 1 handed, then why even include the on screen navigation buttons that you can't adjust /at all /ever? As a formality? a barely functional lie? - My point, Reaching one's thumb, as a right handed person, to the bottom left corner, to go ""BACK"" - A VERY COMMON PRACTICE?!, Is just a massive NO, BAD, BAD PHONE MAKERS, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID! you're almost forcing iPhone mock controls or 2 handed use? oof.

There is no High Screen Resolution for the reg 7, Only Pro* - No 1440p for you, just 1080 (which is fine imo)

The Updates I got? All security, not really any ease of use - So I guess they are hard up to keep this thing like THIS, A Mess. 

Justify owning this thing however you wish, but I see why they pushed me out the door after I was ""Dumb enough"" to not inquire about the Samsung I could have got instead. I can't return it and there is no insurance on it. GG. I better just suck it up and treat her with respect, unlike it's developers. (I can prolly think of more, this is it for now / Should do a real review)

1. Limited storage of 128 Gigs, YET AGAIN! Its 2023 and still Google doesnt offer 256 GB as an option which is a big bummer

2. Charging restricted to 18W. When majority of the Android community has moved to 100W or above, Google is still at pre-historic 18W. Should have given atleast a 33W charging speed if not more. This will take ages to get charged

In India internet speed is not so good in rural areas. This is not a user friendly behaviour by Google. It's a monopoly. We are using Google product itself. So atleast Google can give a access to direct vedio call. So that we can call using carrier network like JIO Vi Airtel. The second thing is pixel get too much heated during normal YouTube suffering and vedio calling via WhatsApp, from both back and front, that it start giving you warning on temperature increase of your handset. That is pathetic. These problem are as it is after many updates rolled out by Google. I had sent my complaint to Google itself till now, that query is in progress.....

I'm In Group 2: Because, Its Google. Neat and Clean OS and Timely OS updates. I 💕 Pixel OS. Everything from Google but, These Pixel phones get heat even when you watch YouTube videos for 5-10 minutes. Such a worst feature of Google Phones anyway.
