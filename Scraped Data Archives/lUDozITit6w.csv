Beebom,"Pixel 7a at ₹43,999 (₹39,999 after card discount. So, are you in group 1 or group 2? 05:53 😇"
SaiKrishna Kote,Group 2
Tech Basics,Waiting for it to come down to 29999 or lower 😅
Jose Sierra,Because it's not true.
Zahid Rashid,Why not go with the Pixel 7? I think it goes for around 45K..
Niladri Basari,group 2
Akshay Mishra,"Kindly make videos about their service, feedbacks, service part costs etc."
Ashish Kande,"Hey Rupesh, 
I own a OnePlus 8t and had a very bad experience with both OnePlus and Oppo devices with their motherboard crash.
Now I'm planning to move to the Pixel devices.
Looking at the current prices I can see that Pixel 6a is a great deal, but still Pixel 7a is pulling me because of its 90 hz display and Sony IMX786 sensor compared to very old sensor on Pixel 6a.
But the only thing I'm worried is about prices. I'm not getting that interest to spend huge amount of money on smartphones. Do you think the 6GB RAM and 60 hz works for me, as I have 120hz and 12gb RAM on OnePlus 8t
Please advise me on this."
shre,Pixel 7a or s21fe?
Robin,I wanna buy a new phone. But my vivo that i bought 5 years is still working fantastically well. Why should i discard something which is working so well to buy a new one. Wouldn't that be like wasting money.
CφηsTaηTiηε,Introduce optical zoom (at least 3x) in mid range than ultra wide camera (never used anyway).
EpicBunty,"costs at least 15k more than my current almost 4 year old ""chinese"" realme phone (price at which i bought) and is still a downgrade in terms of most of the specs like battery, charging speed, performance. oh and not to mention, it does not even have a charger in the box.... lmao. joke."

John Isaac,Is the 256gb varient available in India?
Palash Jangid,"Group 4- People like me who were using Pixel Experience Rom on OP7T and bought Pixel 7A only to realise 7T runs just as good.

Vinod,Does it have a fast charger?
Rajat Mittal,"I already got this pixel 7a, and it's look like flagship phone 🤳📱📱"
Fahad V.S,Group 1😂
Vignesh M,"I have been an avid user of the pixel since nexus times , i think going for the samsung ultra or the iphone is better if you've got the money , else i woud happily settle down for the pixel.
-From the owner of Pixel 7 pro 

It's just that Google has a good software ecosystem but lacks the hardware and supporting ecosytem devices. It's like they limit you on pupose : ("
Tvs Tanuj,Is it worth to buy pixel A series buds which comes in offer after buying this
Unitech,Why are they not providing an Amoled display instead of just OLED... price on higher side
Abhi,I am Group 4: No money to buy.

Deepayan Bandyopadhyay,"Is it safe to buy Pixel phones from Amazon? They are not the official/authorised retailers as per the Google India website. 

I am getting good deals on Pixel 6/6 Pro 5G.  

Should I buy? Please suggest."

ridestiny 200,Group 4 - yaar pese nahi hain yeh phone lene k.
Chetan R,Id like to know If the pixel 6a a good buy now; for someone who isnt looking for everything high end; not very features demanding ?

SAMEER POTDAR,I will wait for 6 to 8 months for this as happend with 6a this will sure come down to 35 to 37 k range ( curremtly using 4a since last 2.5 years and still happy with it...)
VENVOX RACING,"I would like to see the battery comparison with nothing phone 1 , according to specs it is better but the experience is better in pixel .

Iswar Dahal,Group 4: wait for Big billion days 🤠

We want output, as long as 363 delivers it, we have no problem..."
Dinesh J,Does 7a support PD charging technology?
ziluch,I am in group 1
Aritra Samanta,Pixel was always about amazing software experience and the best flagship grade cameras so if you want premium experience and camera i feel you should only go for pixel it just feels premium
Samrat Banerjee,As for the price's concern.. it's obvious I'm in group 1 always 😁😁
MIHIR CHAKRABARTY,"Group 1, definitely overpriced"
Γκοβίντ Τζχα,"For me water resistant is important , because I have the habit of cleaning phone by directly putting it in water , like now I have iphone 12 , it's damaged a lot because I don't use case , and other things are good in it but it's feeling like old , so I'm looking forward to upgrade my device , and I'm waiting for nothing phone 2 , I don't know why but I like it's touch and feel my elder brother have nothing phone 1 that's why , 
Besides that I just want that it need to be water resistant and it can shoot 4k60fps in both the lenses ( not the front one ) because I'm not photogenic person , 
Well let's see maybe if it's not going to be good than might be I'll go for Google pixel 7 ,"
Swastik Banerz,Rather wait for Nothing 2 !!
Ramaṇa Bhaṭṭa,Group 3 — Just pay a little bit more and purchase a Pixel 7.
Sneharsh Belsare,"A lot of companies like redmi and realme ship phones with better specs at lower price, but the software is just terrible. I feel like the great software is worth the premium, so yeah, category 2 it is."
Drink woter,"Too over priced, 44k and the screen isn’t even that good , total bs charging for their software plus almost 0 after-sales support in most of india, would rather wait for nothing phone 2 it will be at this same prcie range same focus of software but with more power and better display and after sales support, this should be around 35k"
Earnist Se,It’s 500 but it comes with free pixel buds and a case from the google store so that’s not bad value really.
Sri Paul,Watching this video in pixel 6a
Sandeep Mehta,In 6 months time it will be 32K then I'll buy it.
Baraa,dos the 7a support esim ?

Koushik Dey,"Group 3 - people know that they will not afford this , but are still watching . 😢"
Pritesh Khilnani,They can never fix the launch price. Never!  46k pix7 VS 44k for 7a...how dumb?
Aditya Bhardwaj,can someone name the wallpaper used in 5:33  from backdrops?
sarthak gangwar,Waiting for about 2-3 months will reduce the price drastically on sales and that is a good time to snatch this Pixel!!
Manas Ohara,have to hold groups till nothing phone(2) comes😀
John Choudhury,Group 3 will wait for the price to drop below 35k
vishal kant,Comparison between Google Pixel 7a Vs Oneplus 11R vs Moto Edge 30 Fusion!!!!!!!!!!!
Nexted Studios,Grp 2 mann
Yash Kudale,My OnePlus 7T display just got busted after buying and using since its launch. I guess it's definitely a upgrade time !
Priyabrat Mishra,"Group 2... Already booked thru pre order, outside India, you get pixel buds A series free with pre order. So effectively got it around same price as India with card discount.
N Group 3 is weird, wait for phone/tech to become old, snap a marginal further discount. Is it worth for mid-rangers?"
Rajesh Dash,Looks like a phone they should have launched in 2021
Nitish Jha,"34, 999 😊 😊is good price."
Ni hal,Group 3: Nothing.
Taruna Dixit,6pro or 7a who is better I'm confused
Akshay,Group 3: can't afford it
ADITYA SINGH,"good package, you'll get a good deal of it in big billion days sale."
Nathanasiel Hernandez,"If the pricing does go down like it usually does after a few months, this will go from being a ""good package"" to being a no-brainer. The 7a's improvements are just astronomical compared to the 6a. *This* is an upgrade"
The Last Stand,Then I am in group 4 who doesn't want pixel phones and go for galaxy S series straightway.
Bhavya Bansal,"Pixel's processor and battery seems weak but the OS on OnePlus 11r is trash and camera also seems ok ok. And no flagship features on 11r except for the processor of course. Will be waiting for Nothing phone 2 , I am hoping it would bring best of both worlds."
Nature Calls Rob,Bad pricing....  Pixel 7 avilable @46000 on sales
ankuran dewgharia,Group 2
TBG Vloggs,Group 4 - Using Iphone❤
Z0R0_X,Not even worth 30k 😑
BLOODY HACKER,They could've launched it on Android 14
Jithin Nhendadiyil,18W charging in a phone released in 2023 is really a crime. I hate iPhone and Pixels for their poor charging speed. Whatever high end features they have charging speed is a basic requirement.
Mridul Singh,Group 2 when I'll be under 35k
Nameless Track,"I'm in middle of those group.
If Non pixel user that's the fact there are some options,OnePlus 11R is the greatest 1 in this price segment, on the other hand people who love pixel and trying buy a Pixel phone in affordable price that's the phone they can pick😊
Good deals from #Google🤝"
Tanbir Mohd,I'm in Group 3 i.e Can't afford.
chandan kumar,Obviously group one. Let us compare it with the recently launched poco F5. It has better processor better  screen better battery better multi-media experience charger in the box headphone jack. Pixel has better software experience (subjective) better cameras and that's it. The price gap is around 15k. That's way too much for an avg user i guess. Google needs to focus on the mid range market and their needs

Vigneesh M,Pixel 7 costs similar😅  isn't it better to buy that instead?

Anmol D,Still sounds non interesting to me.
HIMANSHU THAKUR,"Google pixels are more about Good photos,videos and software. And it does fill that hardware gap with that. Some Samsung phones might provide a better value at that price point, but nothing can match the pixel.❤"
Biswanath Kar,Group 2 but waiting for the Price Drop.

GiyuTomioka,Jenshin Impact 😂😂
Mayur Satpute,G1
Arunangshu Sen,Getting it around 25k with special discount
Dhawal Shah,"I have been using Pixel 6a for the past 6 months, and I would not recommend someone to buy the tensor chip A series of Google. Heat management is a big issue. The phone heats up quickly. Suppose you use Google Maps to go somewhere. After 20 mins, the phone will automatically switch to dark mode to cool down the device. You cannot see the navigation in the day in dark mode. Another incident was I was on an important Zoom call. The device closed the app automatically to cool down the device. There was no way I could shut that feature. I had to wait for the device to cool down. The call was barely 1-1.30 hr. Yes, the photos are amazingly superb, but I have to charge the phone twice a day to keep it live. Pixel A series phones were good till Pixela. It was its peak. Now its downfall, I feel."
Gautam Sidana,No use when battery is shit as last
Kapil Nagpurkar,Elephant in the room: shitty tensor (Exynos) chipset with amazing heating issues and very dim and bad quality display.
Ajinkya Chavan,Groud 3 - Will buy once after price drop
BankaiKiller,Just wait for the Big Billion Sale and buy the Pixel 7 at a better price....40k for this phone isn't worth it

shamsi s,Group 4
Prince,3:24 what? 🤨
Robert,"i will probably go with group 1. Investing in a phone more than 20k is stupidity. The reason is simple, use a phone like a phone and not a computer and a DLSR. Not so complicated right?"
Slip Of Tongue,Group 1 :  be patient. You know what I mean 😂

Diwakar Mathur,isn't pixel 7 available at 45000 on amazon? Why would someone get this at basically the same price?
Viren Vivek,overpriced.... 30k would have given us a better choice.
Abdullah Vlogify,Group 2
Umar Syed,I just have a issue with the price like on amazon the pixel 7 proper is 45k! So for 1k extra doesnt the 7 make more sense? Waiting for some major price drops like the 6a
Sourav Chandra,we need a camera comparison between pixel 7A and galaxy s21 fe..
Amey Mirgal COD,So the people who buys 6A like wasted time and money 😂
srttp2,"I was willing to buy the next pixel phone but it has no fast charging and no 256gb store which are a must for me, guess I gotta wait for the nothing phone 2"

Dark Hat Gamer,Group 3 people are the ones who wait for Big Billion Days and Great Indian Festival where we can see massive price drops 🤓
vedant,Group 2. Because it is still a good package in the price of 40k but as the Google pixel 6a I think its price will also go down so wpi will wait for it
Akash Topder,"1. No 256GB option
2. eSim is still not ready for Indian market
3. Should have 120 Hz AMOLED"
Spit Dragon 💚,"DO Not Buy. Coming from an LGV40ThinQ  to  Pixel 7 (Not Pro) - I feel Downgraded. 

Pixel 7 : *IS A FAUX iPHONE - Let's start there. Know what you're getting into. About 2 weeks owning and using frequently and for many things.

NO HEADPHONE JACK?! THE ONE THING YOU HAD TO MOCK OR EMULATE, REALLY?! As an Audio Lover, A whole generation of people who still know how to use headphone jacks and connect their things to boomin sound systems with 15s and such? - You even have an Equalizer? FOR WHAT? This thing has BAD SOUND! BAD SPEAKERS! (Compared to my LG, That is, Thing was amazing)

Overheats on basic use, VERY HOT VERY VERY HOT? Not using Camera AT ALL? (Seemed to be a ""reason"") HOT AF ON just basic Pokemon Go use? What? Just watch it Glow Red while only attempting to download a few files. I feel I'm going to break it. No kidding. It's that hot. With no case even. 

Navigation buttons / Cannot re-arrange.  What?  Why? Hello?   I see on Forums Years of asking ""WHY?"", so Why?

Pull down top menu? Can't pull down on it's side, There is no Wide, Sidescreen variation, you HAVE to rotate and pull down from top. ONLY

The Camera on the back? Bulbus! edged, sticks out a lot. If you get a message? Phone ""Flat"" on a table? - This thing will slide around as if it was the Winter Olympics.

SLICK CASE - Will slide out of, off of, into, anything. Buy a case ASAP - All Cases I Found btw? If it's not a clunky OTTER style, it's not Flush with the surface. Mostly bad cases for a mostly bad device. *adjusts glasses*

Short battery life that begs me to turn on ""Saver"" features. ""No"" - I want full power, good brightness, loud sound. etc. The base functions of the device Suffer on this electronic and I'm just not sure why.

The Camera? Nice, But - The App it's self (google photos) seems to stumble (maybe it's just me) on most base functions as well, there is no quick way to edit, sometimes, other than RIGHT when you take the pic, this is fine, but the finalization step is a bit tedious when trying to get multiple pics in a timely manner. I'm not a fan of using 3rd part apps constatly (Paying, free versions, ads, etc just to edit a pic my phone took? cmon now, Better default software pls)

The power button and general hand use, Already kinda annoyed that Taking a screencap now makes me pinch and push one side of my phone in order to hit the power and vol down at the same time? Like? What?   Makes WAY more sense, even for smaller hands, to have the buttons be on Opposite sides of the phone? *If it was built to be so quick 1 handed, then why even include the on screen navigation buttons that you can't adjust /at all /ever? As a formality? a barely functional lie? - My point, Reaching one's thumb, as a right handed person, to the bottom left corner, to go ""BACK"" - A VERY COMMON PRACTICE?!, Is just a massive NO, BAD, BAD PHONE MAKERS, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID! you're almost forcing iPhone mock controls or 2 handed use? oof.

There is no High Screen Resolution for the reg 7, Only Pro* - No 1440p for you, just 1080 (which is fine imo)

The Updates I got? All security, not really any ease of use - So I guess they are hard up to keep this thing like THIS, A Mess. 

Justify owning this thing however you wish, but I see why they pushed me out the door after I was ""Dumb enough"" to not inquire about the Samsung I could have got instead. I can't return it and there is no insurance on it. GG. I better just suck it up and treat her with respect, unlike it's developers. (I can prolly think of more, this is it for now / Should do a real review)

This was a Fail."
Rock Voirob,this video makes me sad ;( i just bought pixel 6a 5 days back
polla2256,"I'm from the UK. In group 2 and just ordered a 7a, fed up of the constant random reboots of my Motorola G200. With the G2 chip and embedded AI this should be at least 1000% better than my current pgone."

NmsHouT,we all are gonna wait and buy it on BBD sale !! That will be the best price for the pixel 7a

Bidyut Bikash Das,Watching it in my Pixel 7 and I can't find any difference from my phone apart from maybe glass back.
Shahaan Mohsin,"I just don't understand Beebom's recommendation at times.
How can this be a good package at current pricing, it's priced so closed to pixel 7 (currently retailing at ₹49,999 w/o discount), which has better build + better cameras+ better charging.
Pixel 7a is definitely slightly overpriced, and people will only start getting this once the prices are slashed, just like what happened with 6a."
Harsh Tekwani,Bezels  are deal breaker for 44k
1 is Good,But confusion is 7 all ready price is 45k and 7a price is 43k ? That's mean big brother (pixel 7) is a good choice for purchase!..

Sudipta Sen,"no group, but it in Big billion"

Sibghath Khan,18 w charging lol
BurntW,"Honestly, Pixel 7 is same price as Pixel 7a if you are selling your old phone. If old phone is worth 10k, Pixel 7 will give 3k exchange bonus. + There are HDFC card offers.
Pixel 7a= 44098-4000(Card)-10000(exchange)=30098/-

Rutvik Reddy,In the group that'll prefer the Pixel 7 instead for ~6k more. The pricing really doesn't make sense when Pixel 7 which is clearly a better phone overall costs only 6k more.

WorldforGeeky,Pixel 7 purchase kr le is price me 🥲

avula akshith,"18 Watts charging 😂 , even samsung upgraded s23 series to 45 Watts."
MrV,"I don't know why tech youtubers are ignoring the Network and WiFi issues in Pixel phones? In Pixel 6 series, it was due to a bad modem. But in 7 series they changed the modem and the issue was still there. Google needs to fix this issue ASAP, because the basic fuctionality of a mobile is to make and receive calls🤦🏻‍♂️. Instead of boasting about the camera and AI, may be these tech youtubers has to give a review about connectivity performance from the phones."
vikas mathankar,group 3 - BBD
Mukesh Pawar,Group 3 .. Waiting for a few months to reduce prices like 6A😂😂
Bhawesh,45k for pixel 7 is wayy better deal than this..
Akshay jojo,Im in group one untill the price of the phone goes under 30k
Aman Mondal,I am in group 3 who will wait for 5 months and then buy if when the price falls below 30k or just get the Poco F5 considering I am still using my Poco F1 I seriously need a major upgrade and that Poco F5 is looking great only confused about gcam support since I have been addicted to gcam ever since I was able to install it in this Poco F1 anyways my choices are either 7a or poco f5

Ragboy's Interesting life,"Pixel 7A really impressed me as an all rounder phone with decent Performance, Beast Cameras (for 40k), features like IP67, Witeless charging, etc., Display is Good with 90Hz but not the best with that Thick Bezzels and Battery is decent! But at 44k, ITS NOT A BUY!! Pixel 7 at 45k in sales makes more sense! Wait for BBD and 7A would be available for 35-37k easily! 
But yes its a Good upgrade over 6A"
ARZY,WHEN YOU REALISE THAT ONEPLUS 11R 5G IS A MUCH BETTER PACKAGE THEN THIS ONE!
Aliasgar Abid Sabunwala,Everything Google brings is mind-blowing.
BitCoin Heist,This is not a amoled display?? .. paying 40k for a LCD screen is big no no in 2023 😂😂
CoolGuy55000,"Price of Pixel 7 in India currently is ₹50k! There's no reason to buy a 7a at MRP launch price, if you can spend 44k then you can surely spend 50k. 

Wait for a sale for minimum 10k off and then we start talking."
GOPANNG,EXCEPT THE DESIGN THE REST OF THE PHONE IS AMAZING IN ALMOST ALL ASPECTS
Raudradaman Thakur,Going to buy this one on sale. 🎉
Sujit Tiyar,Group 1
ヴィックン,I purchased pixel 7 on hype because of yes google google but even it had bugs. I had chance to buy s21 fe with way lower price but i still thought because its Google it would be better. I was wrong so before you go ahead and blindly buy 7a i would recommend you to think and check if there are better option per your need.
Micheal Bay,"Is it waterproof, I always dump my phone into 🚽 ?"
Harivansh Chaudhary,I can't ignore those thick black bezels 😐
Ansh Agarwal,Gorilla glass 3 seriously 😂😂😂
SHAIK IRFAN KAREEM ALI,Pixel (& A series) get heavily discounted after a couple of months. Buying it at 44k or 40k is absolute waste of money. Next 3-4 months the phone will be available around 30-35k. That’s when you could pick it up. 😂
Akshay Chaudhary,Overpriced

Iron mask,Group 3 - Wait for the price to drop 😉
Vishwajeet shinde,"I M IN GROUP 1.5
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Wade Wilson,"I just bought it, it prices to 37000 after all discounts, charges 0-100 in 70 mins with Google 30W charger, wireless charging is definitely on slower side. Camera sensors are good but it won't feel like Pixel 7. A good bargain for 37K I would say, definitely a premium upgrade over Pixel 6A but if you have budget for 45-50K, go for Pixel 7 instead of 7A."
Honey Singh,Price should have been less than 40k 🤑🤑🤑
Sampath Kumaar,Group 3 - won’t care about it
Kalu Babu,Eh kanya 😅😅
Yagnesh M. Bhadiyadra,Group 1. Samsung is way better
DURLOV CHANDAN,"My question  is why should  I go for 7a, when 7 is available at the same price after discount?  Is 7A better than 7 , if not then 7A launch does not make sense"
Mayank Jain,I really wish that Google brings 256GB variant too. I think Pixel devices for the price are solid and great devices.
Mr Morningstar,The bezels are just too much

BabyJery S,Galaxy S21 Fe for 32k. Much worth than this👌👌
Baranidharan Sivasankaran,"I am still in group 1 sir... overpriced. The deal breakers for me would be the lack of a 256GB storage (where can I store my 4K footage??) version and fast charging! 18W charging in 2023 is atrocious to say the least! This is where our Chinese friends are differentiating themselves from their rich cousins from the west!! But, I am still hopeful as Google might bring my dream pixel at an affordable price bracket in 2 years timeframe! Fingers crossed!!"
Saurav Badaik,Group 3: can wait for the price drop😂
BREAKOUT ,OVERPRICED....👎
Sajad Bhat,Chatgpt will overtake google before google overtakes 67W charging speed. 🤣🤣
ashish gupta,I will be in group 3 which means that😂its a good phone but generally Google phones price drops alot and will wait till sale where it will be around 30-35k and then will buy it.

Jaseem Ksv,Buy it on sale....
Prasun Shome,"Only 2 things that disappointed me:

1. Limited storage of 128 Gigs, YET AGAIN! Its 2023 and still Google doesnt offer 256 GB as an option which is a big bummer

2. Charging restricted to 18W. When majority of the Android community has moved to 100W or above, Google is still at pre-historic 18W. Should have given atleast a 33W charging speed if not more. This will take ages to get charged

The pricing looks good NGL. However just waiting for the Nothing Phone 2 before deciding which device would be apt for me to upgrade to from my existing OP 9 Pro"
Sub Human,How about Pixel 7?( considering the current pricing between 7A and 7 )
VETRI,Group 2

Arkadeep Majumdar,"I'll be in the Group 3, where I'll buy this Pixel phone 3-4 months after its launch. It has been seen previously also, the prices of Pixel phones drop drastically within 4 months of period. That will be the best balance between Overpriced and Good package."
Ajay Kudtarkar,Can any one help me choose my next phone here ? Pixel 7a or pixel 7 or pixel 6 pro ? My budget is below 45k

Rajan Baliyan,"*I am using Google Pixel 6a device since last 5 months. And I am not able to make direct vedio call via carrier network , I want to directly make a vedio call to my friend, for which I have to use Google's app like Google meet or Google duo for which we have to provided with high speed internet connection. In India internet speed is not so good in rural areas. This is not a user friendly behaviour by Google. It's a monopoly. We are using Google product itself. So atleast Google can give a access to direct vedio call. So that we can call using carrier network like JIO Vi Airtel. The second thing is pixel get too much heated during normal YouTube suffering and vedio calling via WhatsApp, from both back and front, that it start giving you warning on temperature increase of your handset. That is pathetic. These problem are as it is after many updates rolled out by Google. I had sent my complaint to Google itself till now, that query is in progress..... And Google had locked my comment from community, so no other users can relate to my problem. Please its a heartful request to everyone please don't buy new Google Pixel devices, go for any other phn*"

Dev Mehta,Group 2
Dr Thirteen,"One of the most crucial part you neglected is 18w charging, bought 6a for 25999 in latest sales, honestly no big problem with 60hz, wireless charging is not a must have feature and coming to camera it does great post processing so 7a with out fast charging is total waste of money at 44k"

vamshi kailasa,I will buy in next big billion days....😎
Aravinda Babu R,Group 1
hinsing,7a is priced similar as 7 .
Chiru Naidu,I frankly feel like this 7a is not worth the 43k by getting a antutu score of 7lack where all other phones in this price range are getting 7 plus gen 2
Parth Gandha,"6a launched for 44k in July 2022 and is now available around 30k.
Better to wait 6 months for the same thing to happen with this."
Sanjiv Mishra,Buy pixel 7 just by paying a few more bucks u get a lot more

TheCyberVillager,Overhyped!
Harkirat Singh Walia,Very much overpriced ...those thick bezels remind me of Sony Xperia phones 10 years back
Rananjay,"Why no one has a problem with Google giving only one storage option of 128gb? I mean, come on! It's 2023, and 128gb just isn't sufficient anymore for many people. Or they should've at least provided a micro sd card slot in it. Also, 128gb and a plastic back design at 44k look overpriced."
Arshad M,"I am in 11R group. 
Was waiting for pixel 7a, but after watching its launch specifications. Made my mind to go for 11R. 😊"
Saket,Google gives the same processor to a 40k Pixel 7A and flagship phone 1.5L Pixel fold😂😂

6a 23 24 ka aaram se milega ab"
Neev,I am in Canada and I bought the Regular Pixel 7 for $500 Canadian Dollar (30k Rupees). IT is a lot better then the 7a. I will probably sell this one and just pick up the Pixel 8 when it comes out. Pixels don't have amazing specs but there super fun to use. They also do the fundamentals of a phone really well.
PartlyWater,"Considering the $ to ₹ price is 41K, 44K does seem appealing. Dowside is that we don't get the price drops or sales like US market gets."
PMASPHX,Still overpriced as shit 😂😂😂
StaTus,Group 3... After few months price change l!😂

Ojas Sahasrabudhe,I'm in group 1.5!! I was expecting around 49k as it's 499$ but 44k seems good. I said group 1.5 because I may move to group 1 or 2 depending on it's price during BBD sale. Till then I'm sticking with my 4A!! 😀
NR,Is s21 fe better?
Robin Singh,Me still waiting my pixel 4a to give up so that I can upgrade

The Third TV,"Just wait for a few months , google is known for marking down its price and sales or wait for a good carrier deal."
Rahul K,Nothing phone 1 feels like a better package when compared to 7a
Johnprakash #,"Specs are very good!✌️ except storage should be 256GB, Fast charging should be 25w or 30w minimum...for a ₹44000 MRP device!🤞😶"
RAHUL RAWAT,Buying Pixel 7A would better than buying Pixel 7. Suggestion!!
AppleAndPhysics🇮🇳,I think it’s value for money but most of us will be confused for sure between the 7 & the 7A!
Aojesh Shrivastava,2
SD,Wish it had a bigger display not much like around 6.4 inches
samshi vp,Guys let's wait for offer time  it's Group 3 😂 look 6a getting under 30k  hopefully we will get 7a on that price bracket
VampyToast,Its perfect
Vansh Sharma,"The price is gonna drop, soon. Like for 6a, from Rs 43,999 to Rs 28,999."
Jhankar Modak,128Gb storage and slow charging are a deal breaker for me
Mr. Meticulous,Everything is good except the pricing. This one should have been priced at 33K (post discounts) not 40K (post discounts). They are 7K ahead of market's preference.
Bhavesh Pratap Mall,Group 3 wait for the price drop.
Mohit,Ugly bezzels
Shahzad Ahmad,Bezels : I work for TVs but anyway.
mitratanu sarkar,after 4 months this will go down under 30k .. u cant beat that
deslime,"May as well get a pixel 7 with a deal, it's the same phone, what a wasted opportunity to make something different. What they should have done is make a budget $300-$350 pixel 4a remake. That's what the A series is all about."
Aquib Izhar,I am in group big billion days 😅
Abhineet Gupta,I would love to see camera comparison with Apple and samsung flagship phone

professor X,Group 1
Hector papi,Google releasing mid range phones with 90hz while Apple iPhone SE series& regular 13 or 14 non pro editions still capped at 60hz lmao
Arshit Vaghasiya,Group Pixel 7. It's still a good deal overall. I've been using it for 6 months.
D,It will eventually have a price drop (just like the 6a) and I expect it to fall around 33-35k. This would be a good price for the phone
Aayush P.,I bought the 6a last month. What should I do?
Abdullah S,"Is it worth buying a Pixel 6a now for 28000 rupees, given that I need a phone urgently but I will be changing my phone and giving it to my mom after 8 months?"
Abhishek Yadav,"Mark my words this will come down under ₹30k in Big Billion Day Sale.
Not a right time to buy currently."
Lokesh Punia,"For 40k it’s totally good priced, but 44k is bit closer to pixel 7 at 50k 😬"
Yash Jaiswal,it's not worth it.
DipGh,"Definitely someone between Gr 1 and 2. It's a solid package, but would have been better if it was at around 40k. But again, that 4k extra is for Google's brand value and product supply, i understand."
Blink!,better to buy oneplus 11
Sanyam Malhan,No charger in the box so I'm definitely in group 2.
The shorts shot,Group : Being Indian we'll wait till it goes arround 35k

Roronoa Zoro,Group 1
Ankur Aryan,Utne me to pixel 7 aa jayegi
Sandeep Srinivas,Wasn't the Pixel 7 in sale for 50k? why would anyone buy 7a for 44k?
Abhibhav Sahu,Better Charging in both wired and wireless. Smaller bezzles. Better viewing angles. Glass back. Reverse wireless charging.I'd rather choose the normal Pixel 7 for 5-6k more.
Pad-dy drummer 🇮🇳🥁🏵️,Still no Dolby Atmos! Wow Google :(
S C,18w charging 😂 Google just can't make a perfect budget phone can they?
tony lansky,Hate the charging time compared to the one plus nord 3 or poco f5 but the pixel are just so damn smarter then the competition.😢
abhishekt800,Selfie cam is still shit with fixed focus
Abhinav Singh,The S21Fe is still a better option than this... Samsung owns the game man....
Jayant Yadav,"It is 7.5W Wireless Charging at 5:25 👀 A 120 Hz Display, Fast Charging, 256 GB are much needed though..."
ARC NEMISIS,those bezzels are very noticable
Swapnil L,"It's all lovey dovey till you have to claim warranty in India.. trust me, it's not worth the hassle"

COD warrior BD,Definitely i am in group two now. Was in group one last year because of the 60 hz display...
Vamshi,Well im gonna see this video again during BBD
Hardik som,Group 1; only because of gorilla glass 3!!. At least they need to give glass 5 if victus series is costly.
Hardy Electrify,18W charging in 2023 😂 ....u gotta be kidding me.
Sayan Sadhukhan,Group 2
Saswata Chakraborty,I just placed an order for 31867 (exchanging my Galaxy A52s) with 12 months no cost EMI. I think it's the best overall package at 31k.

Ghosh Group,Group 1
Steve Wonder,Good luck charging your phone for 1.3-5 hrs😂😂😂😂

Asura Kengan,"Group 1. Still overpriced as fuck, you can get a 2nd hand iPhone in superb condition and still beat this phone in every department"
Manan Agarwal,I’m in that group who waits for big billion days
Rohit Sarna,i will be in group 1 during bbd sale when it sells for 30k 😂😂😂😂

@beebom"
Akshay G,"Group 3
Waiting the price to get under 30000"
Vikram Chauhan,"I will wait for the price to drop to 25k and then consider buying it. So I'm in neither of the groups. When the 6a came, I was in group 2 and so I love Google phones but they just can't hold the price of the phone. What's the point buying it at the starting price when after 4 months the price will drop by 15k."
Joe C,"plastic back and wireless charging?. If thats possible, why did they bring glass back earlier?"
JaaniRox,Group 1
Aftab Mohamed K,google should stop selling these phones in india!! they are just buting their cash!! .
zameer,Exynose destroying Samsung and tensor will destroy pixel 😉same like color os killing oxygen in OnePlus 🥱🥱
Amol Sharma,Group 3: Buy it in Diwali sale for 30k
Subhajit Panigrahi,Only one downside or rather say cons is their storage options... why font google gives us 256GB option?? Why?? @Beebom
Salman Khan,You can get the pixel 7 for 45k. Why should one save 3k and get downgraded specs?
Thomas Singh,"I just think that people don't look for the overall experience. People look for the high end specs and honestly speaking, it's right but the high end specs will be forgotten by everyone after some months of usage. What pixel is providing is experience, the very clean, best experience, the older pixel phones still run smoothly despite having mediocre chips. You are getting the best camera, best software, best experience which will not degrade. I mean, I know I was also a nerd back then, looking for cores, Ghz and all but now all I want is a reliable phone who will give me more than enough performance when needed and very clean experience."
Shubham rock,"30k for specs + 3k for Google



This much will be enough"
Aditya Shyam Sharma,"I'm definitely in the group to because of the features I was waiting for be in Google 6 was not having such like fast refresh rate and the better cameras and the tensor G2 I think it's a great deal 🤝
And I also attended Google io it's making me excited for the Google pad too"
AV,I am using one plus 11r and it's a Killer at 40k No Compromise as such and OP UI Is also Good . If 7a was launched at 32-33k then it would have been a Killer deal
𝐒𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐊À𝐍𝐆𝐋𝐎,Group 2
vikas Ghindwani,"im ofc in grp 2
But pixel 7 sells for like 50k which is 6000 Rs higher than 7a and it offers better ip rating, better cameras, better speakers, less bezels, gorilla glass victus, faster wireless charging, faster wired charging, glass back.
so... pixel 7 is a better deal for now. 
if pixel 7a could come down under 40k it would be awesome."
The Late Bloomer,I think if someone has to buy a new phone right now they should definitely consider the 7a. But if you can use your current phone till October then this would be a real value for money device around 30-35k during the diwali sale. In either case its a good buy. Kudos to Google.
Jsings,Let the price change happen. Sales. When you get it for 35k to 30k it's a bomb. But that will be 6 months away. I'd stay great phone. Let's wait for the price drop
Archit,"Group 2, and in BBD, there will be Group 3, mad deal."
Techy Ady,Just watched Marces's video but still here 😁
PUNITH SAI,Good package
The SIGMA,it's always gonna be overpriced with that shitty chip.
Sudip Mazumder,Pixel 4a is still my best choice
Rajdeep Paul,Its fair price should be 35000 i still believe 11r and v 27 pro overall better value phones at their price lets wait for phone 2
Kishan Raj,I m in group 3 : the ones who will wait for few months when say it a best deal at 30k after it's price drop
aarambh sharma,"What are they smoking while pricing the phone. 😪
It would sell like hot cakes if they priced it 30k - 32k. And I guess people would understand 35k as well. But 44k. seriously. Why? Why would someone spending 44k not simply buy pixel 7."
CRISIS CR3ATOR,Pixel 6a at 27k >> 7a at 39k until bbd sales
Abhilash Ravichandran,pixel 7 at 43999 now
Sean,Group 3 - who gives a fcuk 🥱
Abhijith B.Lal,Wgy would anyone buy the pixel 7a for 44k when you can buy the pixel 7 for around the same price during a sale

Durgadas,Group 3 - I will buy this in BBD sale at lesser price 😊
Unnat Sadh,But wouldn't people turn towards pixel 7 since there isn't much price difference between 7 and 7a
MAAZ ZAMA,"There is also a Group 3, it includes people who are waiting for price drop in Sales then buy it 🫡🫡"
Owaish Luqman,"Group 3 , will wait for the price drop 😅"

రమేష్ గోకమళ్ళ,"I'm in Group 1 when it is compared to other Smart phone brands like OnePlus and it's 11R device. I got 16GB variant at ₹43000 with exchange.
I'm In Group 2: Because, Its Google. Neat and Clean OS and Timely OS updates. I 💕 Pixel OS. Everything from Google but, These Pixel phones get heat even when you watch YouTube videos for 5-10 minutes. Such a worst feature of Google Phones anyway. Google should fix it with a Snapdragon chipset device. In winter these Pixel devices help you keep you warm all the time. And🔋 life is not that good at any pixel device don't worry about that anyway."

Prakash Kumar Gupta,"It's overpriced no doubt. Don't compare it with pixel 6a, it's actually closer to Pixel 7."
Sahil Saifi,I am just concerned for nothing phone 2🙃😂
aviral srivastava,"The 128 gb Pixel 7 is available under 45k. Isn't that a better value?
 Personally I think 7a with this storage option is overpriced, it would have been a lot better if offered with 256 gb. Since Pixel 7 256gb is almost 55k, many buyers would have considered 7a with 256gb at 40k Also there are options like S21fe with 256gb at almost 35k."
